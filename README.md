# fighter-game

Hello! This is my game inspired by Rock Scissor Paper. Now, We all used to play this game when we were kid. 
We still do play sometimes in order to come to a decision on some things. 

As a person who enjoys playing Rock Scissor Paper, I wanted to make a game off of it. 
Not only that, I created  characters, added some story line, and gave them abilities. 
It ended up becoming more of a fighter game than a Rock Scissor Paper haha. 

All you need to do to play this game is to download all the files to a same folder and run the fighter_game.py file with python in the command prompt or terminal.
I hope you enjoy this game as I have definetely had blast making them and testing them!
Though, Im not a huge game maker so if you have suggestions how to balance the characters please do not hesitate to reach out to me!

Thank you!
